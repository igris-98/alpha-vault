# Why Front-End Frameworks exists?
- SPA ( Single Page Application) is client-side rendering. It's also known as web applications.
- SPA with vanilla javascript. 
	- Front-end web application all about Handling data + Displaying in a user interface(UI).
	- UI needs to stay in sync with data. It's a very hard problem to solve.
	- Keeping UI and Data in sync would be virtually impossible with just vanilla js.
	- Problems with JS & Jquery : eg - Airnbnb
		- It requires lots of direct DOM Manipulation and traversing(imperative - `spaghetti code`)
		- Data(state) is usually stored in DOM, shared across entire app. ( Hard to Reason and Bugs).
- So, Front-End Frameworks exists because `keeping a UI in sync with data is REALLY HARD and A LOT OF WORK.` to **solve this problem and take hard work away from developer.**
- They enforce a `Correct` way of structuring an writing code ( therefore contributing to solving the problem of spaghetti code.)
- [[ANGULAR]] [[REACT]] etc.
