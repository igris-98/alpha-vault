# Algorithm Analysis:
- There are Multiple ways to solve a one problem.
- How do we analyse which one of them is the most efficient algorithm?
	- Generally, when we talk about performance we use an absolute measure.
	- The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted since it's depends on a number of factors.
		- Programming language used to implement the algorithm.
		- The computer on the program run.
		- Other programs running at the same time.
		- Quality of the Operating System.
- We evaluate the performance of the an algorithm in terms of **its input size**.
	- [[TIME COMPLEXITY]]
	- [[SPACE COMPLEXITY]]

#NOTE/DSA/ALGO/ANALYSIS
By Evaluating against the input size, the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparison is also more appropriate.
