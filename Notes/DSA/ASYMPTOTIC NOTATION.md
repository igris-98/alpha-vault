# Asymptotic Notation:
- How to represent complexity?
	- We will do that using Asymptotic Notation.
- Asymptotic Notation are mathematical tools to represent [[TIME COMPLEXITY]] and [[SPACE COMPLEXITY]].
- Big-O Notation (Upper Bound)
- Omega Notation (Lower Bound)
- Theta Notation (Average Bound)


## Big-O Notation:
- It describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms.
- It has two important characteristics:
	- It is expressed in terms of **input**.
	- It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details.

### Big-O Time and Space Complexity:
 - O(1) : Constant
 - O(log n) : Logarithmic
 - O(n) : Linear
 - O(n^2) : Quadratic
 - O(n^3) : Cubic
