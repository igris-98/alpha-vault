[[DSA]]

# Algorithm:
- It is an step by step procedure for solving a computational problem.
- It is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

## Algorithm Characteristics:
- Well defined inputs and outputs.
- Each step should be clear and unambiguous.\
- Language Independent.

## WHY?
- Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve many problems.
- One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms.
- Every Algorithm comes wit its own tread-offs when it comes to performance.


#NOTE/DSA/ALGO
- Multiple algorithms exists for the same problem and there is no right solution. different algorithms work well under different constrains.
- The same algorithm with the same programming language can be implemented in different ways.
- When writing programs at work don't lose sight of big picture rather than writing clever code. Write code that is simple to read and maintain.
