[[RECURSION]]
# Recurrence Relation:
- We assume that every statement in our program takes one unit of time for execution.
- A recurrence relation is a mathematical expression that defines a sequence in terms of its previous terms. In the context of algorithmic analysis, it is often used to model the time complexity of recursive algorithms.
- Recurrence Relations play a significant role in analyzing and optimizing the complexity of algorithms. Having a strong understanding of Recurrence Relations play a great role in developing the problem-solving skills of an individual. Some of the common uses of Recurrence Relations are:
	- Time Complexity Analysis
	- Generalizing Divide and Conquer Algorithms
	- Analyzing Recursive Algorithms
	- Defining State and Transitions for Dynamic Programming.
