# Recursion:
- Recursion is a problem solving Technique where the solution depends on solution to smaller instances of the same problem.
- Recursion is the process of defining a problem (OR the solutions to the problem) in terms of ( a simpler version of) itself.
- Recursion is when a **functions calls itself** until a specific condition is met. This specific condition is called **base case**.

## Why? 
- A great technique to simplify the solution.

#NOTE/DSA/Recursion
- If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller version of the same problem recursion is very helpful.
