# Space Complexity:
- Amount of space taken by the algorithm as function of input size.


#NOTE/DSA/ALGO/SPACE-COMPLEXITY
- There is no one solution that works every single time. It is always good to know multiple ways to solve the problem and use the best solution given your **constraints**.
	- If your app needs to be very quick and has **plenty of memory** to work. you don't have to worry about **space complexity**.
	- If you have **very little memory** to work with. You should pick a solution that is **relatively slow but needs less space**.
