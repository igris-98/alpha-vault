[[JAVASCRIPT]]

In JavaScript, a set is a built-in data structure that allows you to store **unique values** of any type. It is a collection of distinct elements where each value can only occur once within the set. Sets are commonly used when you want to store a collection of items without any duplicates.

Sets are also Iterables.

Here are some key points about sets in JavaScript:

1. Unique Values: Sets only store unique values. If you try to add a value that already exists in the set, it will not be added again.

2. No Order: Sets do not maintain any particular order of elements. The order of insertion is not guaranteed, and there is no direct way to access elements by their index.

3. Value Equality: Sets use value equality to determine uniqueness. Two values are considered equal (and duplicates) if they have the same value, regardless of their type.

4. Supported Operations: Sets provide methods to add values, remove values, check if a value exists in the set, get the size of the set, iterate over the elements, and more.

Here's an example that demonstrates the basic usage of sets in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Creating a new set
const mySet = new Set();

// Adding values to the set
mySet.add(1);
mySet.add("Hello");
mySet.add(true);
mySet.add(1); // Ignored, already exists

// Checking if a value exists in the set
console.log(mySet.has("Hello")); // Output: true

// Getting the size of the set
console.log(mySet.size); // Output: 3

// Removing a value from the set
mySet.delete(true);

// clearing set 
mySet.clear(); // remove all values

// Iterating over the elements of the set
mySet.forEach(value => {
  console.log(value);
});

for (const value of mySet) {
	cosole.log(value)
}


const staff = [ "Waiter", "Chef", "Waiter", "Manager", "Chef"];
const staffUnique = [...new Set(staff)];
console.log(staffUnique);

// different chareacter in my name
console.log(new Set("GambhirRathore").size);
```

In the example above, the set `mySet` is created and values are added to it. The `has()` method is used to check if a specific value exists in the set. The `size` property is used to get the number of elements in the set. The `delete()` method removes a value from the set. Finally, the `forEach()` method is used to iterate over the elements of the set.

Sets are a useful data structure when you need to work with collections of unique values efficiently and conveniently in JavaScript.
