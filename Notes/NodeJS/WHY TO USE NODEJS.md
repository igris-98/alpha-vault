[[NODEJS]]
# Why to use NODEJS:
- Single-threaded, based on event driven, non-blocking I/O model.
- Perfect for building **fast** and **scalable** data-intensive apps.
- JS across the entire stack: faster and more efficient development.
- NPM: huge library of open-source packages available for everyone for free.
- Very Active developer community.
