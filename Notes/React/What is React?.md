[[REACT]]
# What is React?
- React is a JS Library for Building UI.
- It is component-based, declarative, state-driven, extremely popular JS library for building UIs.
- Created By Facebook.

## Component Based:
- Components are **building blocks** of UI in React.

## Declarative:
- We describe how components look like and how they work using a **declarative syntax** [[JSX]].
- Declarative means telling React what a component should look like based on **current data/state**.
- React is abstraction away from DOM. We never touch the DOM directly.
