# code promotion fallacy
- if you spend more time on coding it not necessary you get promotion.
- After you do thousands code changes. Nobody gets impress if you do another one. Now it's expect from you.
- you have to do something which gives you more responsibility and more trust with your teammates. That's more important.
# Ask  for help. 
- first trying to figure it out own your own. If you're still stuck try ask your friend.
- What's the problem you are looking at?
- Why are you trying to solve this problem?
- What have you tried?

# Above Average
- Learning the tools you used every day.
- making debugging flows little bit more efficient.
- make your processes that you're following every day a little bit better.
- day to day workflow little bit efficient than others.

# Other Things beside Coding
## Writing Documents
- Writing things down.
- You could write documents on a bug or a proposal on how to write some code on something. and people will still circulate this months later.
- You get to write the impact of any problems that you're solving and you get to share this with your manager so people know why the work you're doing matters.
- New hires going to pick your documents and try to read it for historical context.
- People share documents and gather around in a meeting to read and talk about your documents. They don't do this with code.
- You're getting visibility and you're getting noticed by other peoples beyond the code reviewers that you would have in your code reviews.
- If you keep writing documents on the same problems. people will start associating you with that area and you'll become subject matter expert in it. People reference you on that area.
